### NLP Approach to Identify Area of Law for Indian Judgements

There are 999 judgements in the Fixed_Judgements folder. The Interview_Mapping.csv file provides the corresponding Area of Law of 899 judgements. The remaining 100, which are indicated by 'To Be Tested' in the Area of Law column, will be used for testing. 

The Mitta_Sneha_script.py is the script to be used for building the model and prediction of results. 

The Mitta_Sneha_Documentation is a walkthrough of the entire script file and also shows some data analysis. 

The Mitta-Sneha_results.csv are the predicted results of the cases which were tagged to be tested.
